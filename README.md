# Birthday-Compatibility-Scraper
This program is the product of bordom and the desire to reflect on old relationships in a manner that justifies my past choices. [Birthday][2] [compatibility][3] [websites][4] are a great place to perform such reflection. This program focuses on the [Cafe Astrology][1] birthday combatilibity tool.

At some point I wondered, if these site are providing numerical scores telling you how compatible you are with people who have a particular birthday, it should be possible to calculate the birthdate of person with whom you are most compatibile... or at least rank your age appropriate options.

This program scrapes the CafeAstrology birthday compatibility tool and prints the resulting scores for every possible birthday match in the range of (The age of the supplied birthdate)/7+7 and (The age of the supplied birthdate-7)*2.
